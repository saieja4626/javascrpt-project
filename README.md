# Simon Says Game 🎮

A fun and interactive memory-based game inspired by the classic **Simon Says**. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project challenges players to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game generates a random sequence of button flashes (colors).
- The player must replicate the sequence in the correct order.
- With each successful round, the sequence grows longer.
- A wrong input ends the game with an alert and allows a restart.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Colorful animated buttons (red, blue, green, yellow).
- 🔊 Unique sound feedback for each button.
- 📈 Progressive difficulty as the game continues.
- ❌ Game over alert with a reset option.
- 🧩 Simple and responsive UI for all screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Structure of the game.
- **CSS** – Styling and layout of buttons and screen.
- **JavaScript** – Game logic, event handling, and sound control.
